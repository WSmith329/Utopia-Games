                <p>Over twenty years ago in Harran, we fought the virus—and lost. Now, we're losing again. The City, one
                    of the last large human settlements, is torn by conflict. Civilization has fallen back into the Dark
                    Ages. And yet, we still have hope.</p>

                <p>You are a wanderer with the power to change the fate of The City. But your exceptional abilities come
                    at a price. Haunted by memories you cannot decipher, you set out to learn the truth… and find
                    yourself in a combat zone. Hone your skills, as to defeat your enemies and make allies, you'll need
                    both fists and wits. Unravel the dark secrets behind the wielders of power, choose sides and decide
                    your destiny. But wherever your actions take you, there's one thing you can never forget—stay human.
