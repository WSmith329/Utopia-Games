            <h3>Lost Judgement</h3>

            <div class="feature-text">
                <p>December 2021, Tokyo district court. Akihiro Ehara stands accused of groping a woman on a crowded
                    train. A bystander's video footage of his attempt to flee the scene and subsequent apprehension is
                    all over the news, and public outcry demands a maximum sentence.</p>

                <p>“Three days ago, a dead body was found in an abandoned building in Yokohama. Have you identified it
                    yet?” he proclaims as confusion cuts through the court room.</p>

                <p>His defense lawyer, Saori Shirosaki, has no doubt that crucial details of the situation have been
                    overlooked, as Ehara was not even tried for the murder. She contacts detective Takayuki Yagami to
                    investigate this further.</p>

                <p>How could Ehara have committed two crimes at once? Was the sexual battery just a cover up? Has Ehara
                    gamed the entire justice system? As victims surface and Yagami digs farther into the truth, he is
                    faced with a question: Defend the law, or enact justice?</p>

                <p>From just a single stumble, one can become a monster…</p>
